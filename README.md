This project 'School is cool' is still in progress.
I am working on this project with the course of 'Adam Romanski' to learn React.



To run the application:
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
